NKW YORK IIIMOKY OF A KNHIHTBV CAN V-IUAN.
Roderick William Cnmcron, the founder and" senior ineiiilier of the shipping film of R. W. Cameron A Co., of No. 211 South William St., has been knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his services in vatrblishing and developing commercial relations between the North American continent and the Australian colonies. The first news received in this city was a cuugratulary despatch from the Marquis of 1,, uue. Governor-General of Canada, which was addressed to Sir Roderick at New York. Mr. Cameron was Imm of Scotch parentage at Glengarry, in the Province of Ontario, Canada, about fifty-seven years ago. He came to this city in DM, when lie was about twenty-five veins of ago, and engaged in the shipping business. The present firm was formed in 1870. In 1852, soon after his arrival here lie sent out the first ship that ever sailed from the Tinted States to Australia This was the beginning of the Australia Pioneer Lino, which since then plied between two countries. The firm afterwards sold its interests in the vessels of the line, but the regular communication is still kept up. Mr. Cameron was Commissioner from New South Wales to the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1870, and also to the Paris Exhibition in 1878. He was honorary commissioner from Canada to the internat iunrl Exhibition at Sidney. New South Wales in 1870, but w as not able to attendit. He was appointed special honorary commissioner from Canada to the Victoria Exhibition, which was held at Melbourne in 1880- 81. He was present during the whole time, and on his return home made a complete report on the conditions and resources of the Australian colonies. To his industrious labors at this Exhibition is due, in large part,his present honor of knighthood. He has always maintained allegiance to the British Crown, and, although lie has spent the most of his iife in New York and has won success there, he has never sought to become an American citizen.
Alsiul fifteen years ago Mr. Cameron took a strong interest in the breeding of racehorses", and established a breeding and racing stable on Saten Island. He imported the famous stallion Leamington, thugreatestsire and the greatest racehorse ever brought to this country.
Roderick is now in England, hav-getting near enough t<. tie short- t clutel^ our sailed from New York last December. » projecting w-" "z 11 *'k to ahull lie His famtiy is in Paris, where his children held until rescued by some |«rtiea who When the

In introducing the Equity to the |teo-pleof Pontiac a duty of grave importance devolves upon us : the duty of defending ourselves and others (whose names have been associated ith out m connection with this enterprise, from the u attach-and gross misrepresentations of parties who, - long before w. hid an opportunity of denning our j» smon w. untiring m their exertions to blast our hopes of success in the field of journalism, imagining by so doing, that they would enlist public sympathy in their lie half, and push to completion the object of their own solutions and unscrupulous ends. Through this means and the medium of the local press, a number of people has been led to believe that our publication is the creature of the so-called " Brvson-Poupore clique;” that it is the personal property of the gentlemen who have the honor of representing this county in parliament ; and that it has been called into existence solely for the purposes of defending themselves, and securing for their own especial benefit, the jiatroiiage of the Dominion and Provincial Governments.

Wallace Rosa has arrived at Portland to go under training for his race with Hanlan, on July 18th, at Ogdenshurg. This will lie a splendid opportunity for any of citizens, who would like to see the great oarsinne.

CotJLONiiï. — Hoping tlrnt you w ill have things in shape to issue your first number, I forward you a few items from Coulonge, that pretty little village containing the "lofty mansions” w hich are such an eye-sure to your neighbor of the Advance.
Firstly, then, there are three new buildings in course of erection, (one intended for a general store), two frame, and one sided timber ; and a fourth, the walls of which have been nip for some time, has been roofed, and I understand is to be fitted up for a tinsmith's shop, which 1 have no doubt, will be a paying investment. The bazaar which has been going on in the Unman Catholic Church here, for the past two weeks, came to a termination on Saturday evening last, when a considerable quantity of stuff, which remained unsold, was put up at auction, anil brought good prices. 1 ilid not leant the exact amount realized from the bazaar, but it could not be less than throe hundred dollars, which went to paying off the debt of the church. It was a decided success, mainly attributable to the energy and perseverance of Rev. T. Nap. LcMoyne, resident priest, who seems determined to at least “ pay as lie goes." The different saw-log concerns on the Coulonge, are busy putting their logs thro' the slide, and out into the Ottawa. Mr. Fraser s square tunlier, in charge of Mr. •tolui Lurry, is all ove. ibe slide, and forty or fifty cribs of it are ahead) rafted up and ready for Qutliec del-stand he will have two hundred cribs, and very handsome, well-made timber it is, too.
Our young friend, Mr. Alfred Gaudier, came home from college last week, where he carried.of the “ gold medal " prize, and a cash prize of sixty dollars, and in fact everything in the way of first prizes. Tlie Coulonge brass liand turned out and serenaded him the next evening after his arrival, when he made a neat little sjicech short--but to the point. I believe he intends to remain at home during the summer months.
Most of our stores are doing a good business just now, as they invariably do when the shanty buys are around.
Business of all descriptions is brisk here; Mr. Morrison, blacksmith, having turned out no less than six new waggons this spring already ; and our two shoemakers, Messrs. McCuaig and Merleau, have more work than they can do. What we Want liadly here, is a good tailor none but a good one need apply. I am certain that a good tailor would do well here. Fur hotels, we have no fewer than four three too many ; but the new license law will regulate that, and cut the uumlier to one. Although there are four, they all seem to pick up a good, easy living.

Drowning Accident. —On Thursday last a young man named Terence Smith, of Chapeau village, aged 23 years, fell off the bridge at Mattawa, and in spite of every effort met with n watei-y grave. He had been engaged as clerk in the store of Messrs. MeCool it Co., at Mattawa. His remains were brought down to the Chapeau, and were followed to the grave by a large concourse of mourners. He was a universal favorite and highly resjiected, and his untimely end has cast a gloom over the entire neighborhood. His friends have the heartfelt sympathy of all in their sad bereavement.

Our Railway.—We jieople of Pontiac have been hitherto sadly deceived in railway matters, and now we find ourselves in the month of June and no work going on. Only a short time ago we were told that the money was raised and that the work would lie pushed vigorously t< completion. Now we are told that the contractor failed in floating a loan in England. The letter report, we fear, is only too trne.
Since writing the above rumors from the lower end of the county, that work on the Pontiac railway ia to be resumed immediately, were floating around here. The approaching county council mooting is, ]>erha|is, the cause of these rumors. In the meantime the council will act wisely in deferring the levying of the railway rate for at least another three months.

OniT.—In tho recent|domiso of Mr. E. W. Murray the County of Ottawa lias lost one of its enterprising and valued residents, and his loss will not be easily forgotten by the many friends to whom he lead socially and otherwise endeared himself. Mr. Munity was bum in England and came to Canada with his father, Jas. Murray, a member of the Royal staff. Mr. E. W. Murray settled in Buckingham some forty-five years ago, and there engaged in tho lumbering business of Messrs. Bigelow & Co. When that firm suspended he assumed business on his own account, and successfully conducted his enterprises for a number of years. He was afterwards selected for the [xisition of Sucre tery-Treasuror of the Municipalities of Buckingham Village and Sownship, a post which he honorably retained until 1880, a period of over twenty yuan. Mr. Murray, although not Iron in Canada, was a truly representative Canadian, (lifted with strong natural ability, altho’ not with early advantages of education, he made himself not only a shrewd liusi-sineas man, but also one of the best read of the Ottawa valley. In business he was energetic and far-seeing, and as a friend generous and steadfast. His funeral took place at Buckingham on Friday last, Fathers Clerk and Clmrlxiuueau officiating. The cortege which followed his remains to the grave was the largest that has been seen in tliat vicinity for many'years. His death lemre* i the commu'iity not essily fiF^X

A False Rumor. —After all the rumpus got up by the local press generally, as well as by the Toronto Globe and Free Press, it seems as if our Local Member, Mr. Pou-pore will not retire in favor of Mr. Mousseau after all. Wo observe the rumour has been contradicted by the writer of the ‘ Chronicles of Pontiac,” who doubtless has sufficient authority to warrant the contradiction. It is a pity Bill won’t cave in and give Mosseau, or some other aspirant, a chance to run for Pontiac.

The statistics lately published by the Jvunud Official, of France, concenung the number of foreigners in Franco are interesting. When the last census was taken, in 1881, the population of France amounted to 87,406.000 souls which number, compared with the population of the count ry in 1870 shows an increase of about 600.000 souls. Of this increase •<00,000 are foreigners. The total number of foreigners is now three |<er cent, of the whole population, but in sonie departments tlw proportion of foreigners is much huger, fc v™,g in some seven and even eight per the inhabitant*
